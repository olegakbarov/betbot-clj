# `betbot`

This is draft version for a Telegram bot that helps to make bets.

## How to

Local development is done through the figwheel which
auto-reloads both client and server code.
To start, run following command:

    lein figwheel

To auto-compile less:

    lein less auto

To deploy to Heroku:

    git push heroku master


### Datbase

For local development configure your DB with following script:

```sql
CREATE DATABASE betbot;
CREATE USER betbot WITH password 'yolo';
GRANT ALL privileges ON DATABASE betbot TO betbot;
```

*Events table*

| title | starts_at | ends_at | category | subcategory | created_at | updated_at|

`events` table created with:

```sql
CREATE table events (
  id SERIAL PRIMARY KEY,
  title TEXT NOT NULL, 
  starts_at TIMESTAMPTZ NOT NULL,
  ends_at TIMESTAMPTZ NOT NULL,
  category TEXT,
  subcategory TEXT,
  created_at TIMESTAMPT WITH TIME ZONE NOT NULL,
  updated_at TIMESTAMPT WITH TIME ZONE NOT NULL
  );
```
