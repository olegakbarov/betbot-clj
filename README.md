# `betbot`

This is draft version for a Telegram bot that helps to make bets.

## How to

Local development is done through the figwheel which
auto-reloads both client and server code.
To start, run following command:

    lein figwheel

To auto-compile less:

    lein less auto

To deploy to Heroku:

    git push heroku master


### Datbase

*Events table*

| title | starts_at | ends_at | category | subcategory | created_at | updated_at|

`events` table created with:

```sql
create table events (id integer primary key default nextval('event_ids'), title varchar(64), starts_at timestamptz, ends_at timestamptz, category varchar(64), subcategory varchar(64), created_at timestamptz, updated_at timestamptz);
```
